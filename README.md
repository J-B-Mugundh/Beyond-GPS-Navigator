## Overview

Beyond GPS Navigator is a pivotal component of our comprehensive 'Integrated Assistive System for Object Detection and Blind Navigation,' crafted to redefine the navigation experience for the visually impaired. Breaking free from the constraints of traditional GPS, this innovative technology empowers users to traverse their surroundings with confidence, regardless of GPS signal availability. By ingeniously sharing location data via email, we not only enhance user independence but also fortify their safety, ushering in a new era of secure and autonomous navigation for individuals with visual impairments

### Objectives

The main objectives of Beyond GPS Navigator is to integrate navigation without the usage of GPS, empowering users to navigate to specific destinations with ease, regardless of familiarity with their surroundings.

### Need for Study

There's a strong need to study and develop this kind of assistive technology for navigation due to:

- **Greater Accessibility and Inclusion:** Empowers people with visual impairments to navigate more confidently and independently, also benefiting those with low vision or situational awareness challenges.
- **Improved Emergency Response:** Automatic location sharing allows for quicker assistance in emergencies, providing peace of mind for users and caregivers.
- **Universally Applicable Navigation Solutions:** The ability to navigate using pre-loaded information (PDF data) can be helpful in situations where GPS is unreliable, such as indoors or in dense urban areas.

### Evaluation Criteria

The success of Beyond GPS Navigator will be evaluated based on:

- Usability and ease of use for the target audience.
- Effectiveness of the real-time voice feedback system in assisting navigation.
- Reliability and functionality of the GPS location sharing feature.
- Capability and performance of the virtual voice assistant in understanding user queries and providing navigation guidance.
- Success rate of navigation using pre-loaded route information (PDF data) without GPS dependence.
